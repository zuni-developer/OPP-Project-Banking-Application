# 🏦 Bank Management System (Java Swing)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Bank Management System** is a desktop-based Java application built using **Java Swing** to simulate fundamental banking operations. The project demonstrates **object-oriented programming**, **GUI-based interaction**, and **file-based persistence** without relying on external databases.

It is intended primarily for **academic learning**, focusing on how real-world banking workflows can be modeled using core Java concepts.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Practice **Java Swing GUI development**
* Apply **OOP principles** 
* Implement **event-driven programming**
* Persist data using **file handling**
* Understand basic **banking workflows** in software form

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Create new bank accounts
* Manage account details through a GUI
* Perform basic banking operations (deposit, withdrawal, transfers)
* Maintain persistent account records using text files
* Simple and intuitive graphical interface
* Background image integration for improved UI aesthetics

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java  
* **GUI Framework:** Java Swing  
* **Core Concepts:**
  * Object-Oriented Programming
  * Event Handling
  * File I/O
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (recommended), NetBeans also supported

### 📁 Folder Explanation

* **`src/`** – Core Java source files  
* **`img/`** – UI assets such as background and logo images  
* **`out/production/`** – Compiled `.class` files (auto-generated by IDE)  
* **`Accounts.txt`** – Stores account-related data persistently  
* **`.iml` file** – IntelliJ IDEA project configuration

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Ensure **Java JDK (8 or later)** is installed  
2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**  
3. Verify that image files are present inside the `img/` folder  
4. Run the application from:

   ```
   src/Main.java
   ```

5. Use the GUI menu/buttons to perform banking operations

---

## 💾 Data Storage

* All account information is stored in **`Accounts.txt`**
* The file is automatically created and updated at runtime
* Data remains available across multiple executions

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* No database integration (text-file based storage only)
* No authentication or role-based access
* Limited input validation
* Not designed for production or real banking use

---

## 🔮 Possible Future Enhancements

* Integrate **MySQL / SQLite** database
* Add user authentication (Admin / Customer roles)
* Improve GUI using layout managers (GridBagLayout, JavaFX)
* Add transaction history per account
* Implement exception handling and validations
* Encrypt stored data for security
